### Introduction

Data Science or data-intensive computing process involves a phase where preliminary understanding of the
characteristics of the data is explored. This phase is commonly known as exploratory data analysis (EDA).
This is a very useful phase before launching onto a full scale bigdata analytics that often requires 
extensive infrastructure support and complex or newer algorithms such as Hadoop-Mapreduce on a large cluster.
The algorithms and methods we will use in EDA are also highly applicable and useful to perform (run) 
statistical analysis on the outputs of big-data processing. In my experience with data, EDA is perfect 
complement to big-data analytics. EDA lets you gain intuition about the data in the early phases and it
also offers you a systematic approach to choosing among the many possible results of big-data analytics

### Description

We worked on a fairly large airport data set (around 1GB) for the year of 2006 and 2007. We ran statistics
on this data to perform EDA using the steps mentioned in the Chapter 2 of the [Oreilly Doing Data Science Book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do)
and prepared a report based on the EDA. Also we have provide the provenance for the results in the [Report]()

### Evaluation

Follow the below steps to evaluate our exploratory data analysis

1. Open RGui or RStudios
2. Import the necessary datasets from the sources specified in the report.
3. Use the necessary R files for the necessary computation.
4. Cross- verify the results with the report.
